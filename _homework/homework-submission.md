The Github classroom link automates the process of setting up a private repository with template code for your homework assignments, but does *NOT* handle submitting your code for grading. Instead, to submit your homework you must:

  1. Submit a link to your homework repository in Canvas before the deadline. You can do this *immediately* after creating the homework repository using Github classroom. (It is the same assignment in Canvas that had the Github classroom link.)

  2. Regularly commit and push your homework code as you develop to your repository. Remember, [you must have several commits](/guides/homework/homework-requirements.html) in your repository to receive full credit for your homework assignment.

  3. Stop committing your homework code in the `master` branch before the homework deadline to avoid any [late penalties]({{ "/syllabus.html#homework" | relative_url }}). You may continue developing your code in another branch if you want to try and pass additional tests. If you manage to fix enough issues that you want to submit your latest changes and accept the late penalty, go ahead and merge those changes back into the `master` repository.

When done, double-check your submission by running the `homework` script on the lab computers. See the [Homework Testing](/guides/homework/homework-testing.html) guide for details.
