Final code reviews are conducted during finals week. Each final code review appointment is 30 minutes each. You may sign up for an appointment on Canvas at:

  - [Final Code Review Signup](https://usfca.instructure.com/calendar2#view_name=agenda&view_start=2019-05-14&find_appointment=course_1582958)

Each eligible student must sign up for exactly 1 final code review appointment. Make sure to sign up early to avoid any conflicts with holiday travel or other final exams. **You must be on-time to your appointment.**

  <div class="message-body"><i class="far fa-exclamation-triangle"></i>&nbsp;Treat your appointment like a final exam; if you miss it you do not get another opportunity and receive a 0 for any outstanding project grades.</div>
</article>

{% include section.html level="h2" name="Cutoff Deadlines" %}

Which projects you have graded during your final code review appointment depend on how many projects you have passed before the end of the semester.

The last date you can have a normal code review appointment or request project verification is:

> **Friday, May 10, 2019**

This is the same deadline as the <a href="/syllabus.html#important-dates">project cutoff 2</a> deadline for <strong>Project Pass Requirement 2</strong>. Therefore, <span class="has-text-danger">this date is your last chance to pass a project 2 code review or project 3 functionality and avoid an automatic F for the course</span>.

Please note this is <strong>NOT</strong> the cutoff to <em>request</em> code review! This is the cutoff to pass a code review. Code review requests must be made earlier. See below for details.

<article class="message is-danger">
  <div class="message-body"><i class="far fa-exclamation-triangle"></i>&nbsp;If you fail to meet the <strong>Project Pass Requirement 2</strong> by the cutoff, you will receive an automatic F and should cancel your final code review appointment.</div>
</article>

{% include section.html level="h4" name="Code Review Request Cutoff" %}

The cutoff to request a normal code review is:

> **Wednesday, May 8, 2019**

If you create an issue requesting code review by 11:59pm on this date, I will guarantee you an appointment on the cutoff date. However, it may be in the evening. Please plan accordingly.

There is no guarantee that code review requests submitted after this point will be fulfilled. Instead, it is likely your project design will not be graded until your final code review appointment.

{% include section.html level="h4" name="Verification Cutoff" %}

All issues for project verification (and requests for functionality grades to be updated) must be received by 11:59pm on the cutoff deadline. Specifically, you must have a release that passes the functionality tests and an issue *properly* created on Github asking for verification by 11:59pm on this date. (The issue does not need to be closed by this date.)

The functionality of any outstanding projects after this point will be evaluated in your final code review appointment. If you submit an issue for project verification *after* this point, it will not be graded until your final code review appointment.

{% include section.html level="h2" name="Final Project Grading" %}

The project(s) you have graded during this appointment depends on what projects you have passed before the cutoff deadlines (see above). Specifically:

  - If you are not passing Project 2 code review or Project 3 functionality by the cutoff, you are NOT passing the Project Pass Requirement 2. You will receive an automatic F for the course and are not eligible for a final code review appointment.

  - If you are not passing Project 3 code review by the cutoff, regardless of whether you are passing Project 4 Web Crawler functionality, then you will earn a grade for Project 3 code review and Project 4 Web Crawler functionality (if needed) during your final code review appointment.

  - If you are passing Project 3 code review, you will earn a grade for Project 4 Web Crawler functionality (if needed) during your final code review appointment. If you pass Project 4 Web Crawler functionality before or during your final code review appointment, then you will also have Project 4 Search Engine graded.

You can use the [What-If Grades](https://guides.instructure.com/m/4212/l/55065-how-do-i-approximate-my-assignment-scores-using-the-what-if-grades-feature) feature in Canvas to estimate the impact this will have on your final letter grade for the course.

You will receive your final grade for the course at the end of your final code review appointment.
